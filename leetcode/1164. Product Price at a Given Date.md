# 1164. Product Price at a Given Date

## Description
Table: `Products`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
```
Â 

Write an SQL query to find the prices of all products on `2019-08-16`. Assume the price of all products before any change is `10`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 
Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
Output: 
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+
```


## Solution

### MySQL
```mysql
SELECT
    DISTINCT p1.product_id,
    IF(price IS NULL, 10, price) AS price
  FROM Products p1
    LEFT JOIN (
      SELECT
  product_id,
  price
FROM (
SELECT
    product_id,
    new_price AS price,
    change_date,
    row_number() over(partition by product_id order by change_date desc) as rn
  FROM Products
WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
) q
WHERE rn = 1
) p2 ON p1.product_id = p2.product_id;
```
