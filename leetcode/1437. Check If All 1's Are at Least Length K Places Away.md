# 1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away

## Description
Given an binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` *if all* `1`*'s are at least* `k` *places away from each other, otherwise return* `false`.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```

#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_2_1791.png)
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        all_1_indexes = [i for i, v in enumerate(nums) if v == 1]
        for i in range(1, len(all_1_indexes)):
            if abs(all_1_indexes[i] - all_1_indexes[i-1]-1) < k: return False
        return True
```
