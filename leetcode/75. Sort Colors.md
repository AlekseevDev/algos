# 75. Sort Colors

## Description
Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```


## Solution

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, elements: List[int]) -> None:
        swapped = False
        for n in range(len(elements)-1, 0, -1):
            for i in range(n):
                if elements[i] > elements[i + 1]:
                    swapped = True
                    elements[i], elements[i + 1] = elements[i + 1], elements[i]       
            if not swapped:
                return
        return elements
```
