# 389. Find the Difference

## Description
You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        s, t = Counter(s), Counter(t)
        for i in t:
            if i not in s or t[i]-s[i] > 0: 
                return i
```
