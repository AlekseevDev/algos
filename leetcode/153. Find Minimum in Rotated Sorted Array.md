# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Description
Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

* `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
* `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must write an algorithm that runs inÂ `O(log n) time.`

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```


## Solution

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getRotatedPoint(self, nums: List) -> int:
        len_nums = len(nums)
        if len_nums == 1:
            return None
        if len_nums == 2:
            if nums[0][1] > nums[1][1]:
                return nums[1][0]
            else:
                return None
        indx = len_nums // 2
        if nums[indx-1][1] > nums[indx][1]:
            return nums[indx][0]
        return self.getRotatedPoint(nums[indx:]) or self.getRotatedPoint(nums[:indx])

    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        point = self.getRotatedPoint(list(enumerate(nums)))
        if point is None:
            return nums[0]
        else:
            return nums[point]
```
