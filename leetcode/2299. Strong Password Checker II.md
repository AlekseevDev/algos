# 2299. Strong Password Checker II

## Description
A password is said to be **strong** if it satisfies all the following criteria:

* It has at least `8` characters.
* It contains at least **one lowercase** letter.
* It contains at least **one uppercase** letter.
* It contains at least **one digit**.
* It contains at least **one special character**. The special characters are the characters in the following string: `"!@#$%^&*()-+"`.
* It does **not** contain `2` of the same character in adjacent positions (i.e., `"aab"` violates this condition, but `"aba"` does not).

Given a string `password`, return `true` *if it is a **strong** password*. Otherwise, return `false`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: password = "IloveLe3tcode!"
Output: true
Explanation: The password meets all the requirements. Therefore, we return true.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: password = "Me+You--IsMyDream"
Output: false
Explanation: The password does not contain a digit and also contains 2 of the same character in adjacent positions. Therefore, we return false.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: password = "1aB!"
Output: false
Explanation: The password does not meet the length requirement. Therefore, we return false.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def strongPasswordCheckerII(self, password: str) -> bool:
        special_chars = "!@#$%^&*()-+"
        criterias = [len(password) >= 8, False, False, False, len(set(special_chars) & set(password)) > 0, True]
        last_i = 0
        for i in password:
            if i.isdigit():
                criterias[3] = True
            elif i not in special_chars and i == i.lower():
                print(i)
                criterias[1] = True
            elif i not in special_chars and i == i.upper():
                criterias[2] = True
            if last_i == i:
                criterias[5] = False
            last_i = i
        return sum(criterias) == 6
