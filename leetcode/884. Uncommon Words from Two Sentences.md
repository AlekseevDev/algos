# 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

## Description
A **sentence** is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is **uncommon** if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and **does not appear** in the other sentence.

Given two **sentences** `s1` and `s2`, return *a list of all the **uncommon words***. You may return the answer in **any order**.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]
```

class Solution:
    def uncommonFromSentences(self, A: str, B: str) -> List[str]:
        C = A.split() + B.split()
        slovar = {}
        ans = []
        for i in C:
            if i not in slovar:
                slovar[i] = 1
            else:
                slovar[i] += 1
        for i in slovar:
            if slovar[i] == 1:
                ans.append(i)
        return ans
