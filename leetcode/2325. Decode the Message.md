# 2325. Decode the Message

## Description
You are given the strings `key` and `message`, which represent a cipher key and a secret message, respectively. The steps to decode `message` are as follows:

1. Use the **first** appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters in `key` as the **order** of the substitution table.
2. Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
3. Each letter in `message` is then **substituted** using the table.
4. Spaces `' '` are transformed to themselves.

* For example, given `key = "**hap**p**y** **bo**y"` (actual key would have **at least one** instance of each letter in the alphabet), we have the partial substitution table of (`'h' -> 'a'`, `'a' -> 'b'`, `'p' -> 'c'`, `'y' -> 'd'`, `'b' -> 'e'`, `'o' -> 'f'`).

Return *the decoded message*.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: key = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", message = "vkbs bs t suepuv"
Output: "this is a secret"
Explanation: The diagram above shows the substitution table.
It is obtained by taking the first appearance of each letter in "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
```

#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/08/ex2new.jpg)
```
Input: key = "eljuxhpwnyrdgtqkviszcfmabo", message = "zwx hnfx lqantp mnoeius ycgk vcnjrdb"
Output: "the five boxing wizards jump quickly"
Explanation: The diagram above shows the substitution table.
It is obtained by taking the first appearance of each letter in "eljuxhpwnyrdgtqkviszcfmabo".
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def decodeMessage(self, key: str, message: str) -> str:
        keys, z = {" ": " "}, 0
        alph = [chr(i) for i in range(97, 123)]
        for i in [i for i in list(key.replace(" ", ""))]:
            if i not in keys:
                keys[i] = alph[z]
                z += 1
        return "".join([keys[i] for i in list(message)])
```
