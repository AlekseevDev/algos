# 414. Third Maximum Number

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return *the **third distinct maximum** number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the **maximum** number*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def thirdMax(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(set(nums)) < 3: return max(nums)
        return max([i for i in sorted(set(nums), reverse=True)[2::3]])
```
