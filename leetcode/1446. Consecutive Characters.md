# 1446. Consecutive Characters

## Description
The **power** of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Given a string `s`, return *the **power** of* `s`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        res, last_char, temp = 0, s[0], 1
        for i in (s+"1")[1:]:
            if i != last_char:
                res = max(res, temp)
                last_char, temp = i, 0
            temp += 1
        return res
```
