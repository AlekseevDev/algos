# 1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters

## Description
Given a string `s`, return *the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters.* If there is no such substring return `-1`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aa"
Output: 0
Explanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abca"
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "cbzxy"
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(self, s: str) -> int:
        result = [-1]
        counter_s = Counter(s)
        for i in set(s):
            if counter_s[i] > 1:
                start = s.index(i)        
                stop = (s[::-1].index(i)+1) * -1
                result.append(len(s[start+1:stop]))
        return max(result)
        
```
