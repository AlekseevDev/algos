# 1496. Path Crossing

## Description
Given a string `path`, where `path[i] = 'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by `path`.

Return `true` *if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited*. Return `false` otherwise.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: path = "NES"
Output: false 
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
```

#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/10/screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123843-pm.png)
```
Input: path = "NESWW"
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def isPathCrossing(self, path: str) -> bool:
        points, p = [], [0, 0]
        for i in path+"m":
            if p in points: return True
            points.append(p.copy())
            if i == "N": p[0] += 1
            if i == "S": p[0] -= 1
            if i == "E": p[1] += 1
            if i == "W": p[1] -= 1
        return False
```
