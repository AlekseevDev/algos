# 1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them from the array.

Return *the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        counter_nums = Counter(nums)
        for num in nums:
            if (k-num != num and counter_nums.get(k-num, 0) > 0 and counter_nums[num] > 0) or \
                (k-num == num and counter_nums.get(num, 0) >= 2):
                result += 1
                counter_nums[k-num] -= 1
                counter_nums[num] -= 1
        return result
```
