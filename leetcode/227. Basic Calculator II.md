# 227. Basic Calculator II

## Description
Given a string `s` which represents an expression, *evaluate this expression and return its value*.Â 

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of `[-231, 231 - 1]`.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "3+2*2"
Output: 7
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = " 3/2 "
Output: 1
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        s = ("+" + s.replace(" ", "")\
        .replace("+", " +").replace("*", " *")\
        .replace("-", " -").replace("/", " /")).split()
        deq = []

        for i in s:
            if "-" in i or "+" in i:
                deq.append(int(i))
            else:
                deq[-1] = int(str(deq[-1]/int(i[1:])).split(".")[0]) if "/" in i else deq[-1]*int(i[1:])

        return sum(deq)
