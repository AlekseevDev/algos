# 890. Find and Replace Pattern

## Description
Given a list of strings `words` and a string `pattern`, return *a list of* `words[i]` *that match* `pattern`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.

Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def findAndReplacePattern(self, words: List[str], pattern: str) -> List[str]:
        chars = [str(chr(i)) for i in range(48, 123)]
        codes = ["".join(random.choices(chars, k=5)) for i in range(len(set(pattern)))]

        def func(word: list):
            m, c = {}, codes.copy()
            for i in range(len(word)):
                if word[i] not in m:
                    if not c: break
                    m[word[i]] = c.pop()
                word[i] = m[word[i]]
            return "".join(word)

        return [i for i in words if func(list(i)) == func(list(pattern))]
