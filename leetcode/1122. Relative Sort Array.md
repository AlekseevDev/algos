# 1122. Relative Sort Array

## Description
Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the elements of `arr2` are distinct, and all elements in `arr2` are also in `arr1`.

Sort the elements of `arr1` such that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are the same as in `arr2`. Elements that do not appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in **ascending** order.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: arr1 = [28,6,22,8,44,17], arr2 = [22,28,8,6]
Output: [22,28,8,6,17,44]
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def relativeSortArray(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = []
        for i in arr2:
            if i in arr1:
                ans += [i]*arr1.count(i)
        
        return ans + sorted(list(filter(lambda x: x not in ans, arr1)))
```
