# 2523. Closest Prime Numbers in Range

## Description
Given two positive integers `left` and `right`, find the two integers `num1` and `num2` such that:

* `left <= nums1 < nums2 <= right` .
* `nums1` and `nums2` are both **prime** numbers.
* `nums2 - nums1` is the **minimum** amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.

Return *the positive integer array* `ans = [nums1, nums2]`. *If there are multiple pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the minimum* `nums1` *value or* `[-1, -1]` *if such numbers do not exist.*

A number greater than `1` is called **prime** if it is only divisible by `1` and itself.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: left = 10, right = 19
Output: [11,13]
Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 19 are 11, 13, 17, and 19.
The closest gap between any pair is 2, which can be achieved by [11,13] or [17,19].
Since 11 is smaller than 17, we return the first pair.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: left = 4, right = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There exists only one prime number in the given range, so the conditions cannot be satisfied.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def isPrime(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 1: return False
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)+1)):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    def closestPrimes(self, left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
        collector = []
        for i in range(left, right+1):
            if self.isPrime(i):
                if collector and i - collector[-1] <= 2:
                    return [collector[-1], i]
                collector.append(i)
        if len(collector) < 2:
            return [-1, -1]

        gaps = ([collector[i - 1], collector[i]]
                for i in range(1, len(collector)))

        return min(gaps,
                   key=lambda gap: (gap[1] - gap[0], gap[0]),
                   default=[-1, -1])
