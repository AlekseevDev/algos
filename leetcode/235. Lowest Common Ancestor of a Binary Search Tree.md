# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

## Description
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        p_acestors, q_acestors = set(), set()
        def dfs(root, l=None):
            nonlocal p_acestors, q_acestors
            if not root:
                return
            if root == p:
                p_acestors = (l if l else []) + [p.val]
            if root == q:
                q_acestors = (l if l else []) + [q.val]
            dfs(root.left, l+[root.val])
            dfs(root.right, l+[root.val])

        dfs(root, l=[])
        print(p_acestors, q_acestors)
        if p_acestors < q_acestors:
            q_acestors, p_acestors = p_acestors.copy(), q_acestors.copy()
        for i in p_acestors[::-1]:
            if i in q_acestors:
                return TreeNode(val=i)
