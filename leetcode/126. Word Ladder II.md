# 126. Word Ladder II

## Description
A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

* Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
* Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
* `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return *all the **shortest transformation sequences** from* `beginWord` *to* `endWord`*, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words* `[beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk]`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
Explanation:Â There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
"hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```


## Solution

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findLadders(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        wordList = set(wordList)
        if endWord not in wordList:
            return []
        # BFS visit
        curr_level = {beginWord}
        parents = collections.defaultdict(list)
        while curr_level:
            wordList -= curr_level
            next_level = set()
            for word in curr_level:
                for i in range(len(word)):
                    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                        new_word = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]
                        if new_word in wordList:
                            next_level.add(new_word)
                            parents[new_word].append(word)
            if endWord in next_level:
                break
            curr_level = next_level
        # DFS reconstruction
        res = []
        def dfs(word, path):
            if word == beginWord:
                path.append(word)
                res.append(path[::-1])
            else:
                for p_word in parents[word]:
                    dfs(p_word, path + [word])
        dfs(endWord, [])
        return res
```
