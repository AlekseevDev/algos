Â 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```


## Solution

### MySQL
```mysql
SELECT 
    DISTINCT l.num AS ConsecutiveNums
  FROM Logs l
    LEFT JOIN Logs q ON l.id = q.id-1 AND l.num = q.num
    LEFT JOIN Logs q2 ON l.id = q2.id-2 AND l.num = q.num
WHERE l.num = q.num AND q.num = q2.num;
```
