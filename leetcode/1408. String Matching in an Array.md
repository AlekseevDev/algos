# 1408. String Matching in an Array

## Description
Given an array of string `words`, return *all strings in* `words` *that is a **substring** of another word*. You can return the answer in **any order**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string

#### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]
Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
Output: ["et","code"]
Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
Output: []
Explanation: No string of words is substring of another string.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def stringMatching(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        for i in range(len(words)):
            w = words.copy()
            w.pop(i)
            if list(filter(lambda x: words[i] in x, w)):
                res.append(words[i])
        return res
```
