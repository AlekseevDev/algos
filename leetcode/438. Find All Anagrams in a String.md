# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

## Description
Given two strings `s` and `p`, return *an array of all the start indices of* `p`*'s anagrams in* `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        res, p = [], sorted(p)
        for i in range(len(s)-len(p)+1):
            if sorted(s[i:i+len(p)]) == p:
                res.append(i)
        return res
```
