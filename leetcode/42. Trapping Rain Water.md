# 42. Trapping Rain Water

## Description
Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        h_len = len(height)
        biggest_left: list[int] = [height[0]] * h_len
        biggest_right: list[int] = [height[-1]] * h_len

        for i in range(1, h_len):
            biggest_left[i] = max(biggest_left[i-1], height[i])
            biggest_right[-i-1] = max(biggest_right[-i], height[-i-1])
        
        return sum(min(biggest_left[i], biggest_right[i]) - height[i] for i in range(h_len))
```
