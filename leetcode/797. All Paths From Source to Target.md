# 797. All Paths From Source to Target

## Description
Given a directed acyclic graph (**DAG**) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in **any order**.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/28/all_1.jpg)
```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
```

#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/28/all_2.jpg)
```
Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        graph = {i: v for i, v in enumerate(graph)}
        result = []
        
        def helper(leaves, temp_res = None):
            if temp_res is None: 
                temp_res = [0]
            if temp_res[-1] == len(graph)-1: 
                result.append(temp_res)
            for l in leaves:
                helper(graph[l], temp_res + [l])
        
        helper(graph[0])
        return result
```
