# 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL

## Description
> Note: This is a companion problem to the [System Design](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/system-design/) problem: [Design TinyURL](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/124658/Design-a-URL-Shortener-(-TinyURL-)-System/).

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`. Design a class to encode a URL and decode a tiny URL.

There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

Implement the `Solution` class:

* `Solution()` Initializes the object of the system.
* `String encode(String longUrl)` Returns a tiny URL for the given `longUrl`.
* `String decode(String shortUrl)` Returns the original long URL for the given `shortUrl`. It is guaranteed that the given `shortUrl` was encoded by the same object.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: url = "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"
Output: "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"
Explanation:
Solution obj = new Solution();
string tiny = obj.encode(url); // returns the encoded tiny url.
string ans = obj.decode(tiny); // returns the original url after decoding it.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Codec:
    def __init__(self):
        self.links = {}

    def encode(self, longUrl: str) -> str:
        if longUrl not in self.links:
            from random import choices
            k = [str(i) for i in range(10)]+[chr(i) for i in list(range(65, 91))+list(range(97, 123))]
            shortUrl = "".join(choices(k, k=6))
        else:
            self.links[longUrl]

        self.links[shortUrl] = longUrl
        self.links[longUrl] = shortUrl
        return shortUrl

    def decode(self, shortUrl: str) -> str:
        return self.links[shortUrl]


        

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.decode(codec.encode(url))
```
