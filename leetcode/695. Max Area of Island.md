# 695. Max Area of Island

## Description
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return *the maximum **area** of an island in* `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def bfs(self, grid, i, j, n, m, count):
        if (i<0 or j<0 or j>=m or i>=n or grid[i][j]==0):
            return;
        if (grid[i][j] == 1):
            self.count += 1; grid[i][j] = 0;
        self.bfs(grid, i, j+1, n, m, self.count)
        self.bfs(grid, i, j-1, n, m, self.count)
        self.bfs(grid, i+1, j, n, m, self.count)
        self.bfs(grid, i-1, j, n, m, self.count)
        
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        self.count = 0; maxval = 0
        n = len(grid); m = len(grid[0])
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (grid[i][j] == 1):
                    self.bfs(grid, i, j, n, m, self.count)
                    maxval = max(maxval, self.count); self.count = 0;
        return maxval
