# 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

## Description
You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and a character `target`. There are **at least two different** characters in `letters`.

Return *the smallest character in* `letters` *that is lexicographically greater than* `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
Output: "x"
Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        res = sorted(set(letters + [target]))
        next_after_target = res.index(target)+1
        return res[next_after_target] if next_after_target < len(res) else letters[0]
```
