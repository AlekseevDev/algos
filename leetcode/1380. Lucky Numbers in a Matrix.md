# 1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix

## Description
Given an `m x n` matrix of **distinct** numbers, return *all **lucky numbers** in the matrix in **any** order*.

A **lucky number** is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
Output: [15]
Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
Output: [12]
Explanation: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
Output: [7]
Explanation: 7 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def luckyNumbers (self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # [[3,7,8],
        #  [9,11,13],
        #  [15,16,17]]
        
        d = []
        
        
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
                if matrix[i][j] == min(matrix[i]):
                    z = 0
                    for r in matrix:
                        if r[j] <= matrix[i][j]:
                            z += 1
                    if z == len(matrix):
                        d.append(matrix[i][j])
        
        return d
```
