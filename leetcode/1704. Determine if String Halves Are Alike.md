# 1704. Determine if String Halves Are Alike

## Description
You are given a string `s` of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let `a` be the first half and `b` be the second half.

Two strings are **alike** if they have the same number of vowels (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`, `'A'`, `'E'`, `'I'`, `'O'`, `'U'`). Notice that `s` contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return `true` *if* `a` *and* `b` *are **alike***. Otherwise, return `false`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "book"
Output: true
Explanation: a = "bo" and b = "ok". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "textbook"
Output: false
Explanation: a = "text" and b = "book". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.
Notice that the vowel o is counted twice.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def halvesAreAlike(self, s: str) -> bool:
        alike = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
        s = [s[:len(s)//2].lower(), s[len(s)//2:].lower()]
        for c, i in enumerate(s):
            z = 0
            for y in i:
                z = z+1 if y in alike else z
            s[c] = z
        print(s)
        return s[0] == s[1]
```
