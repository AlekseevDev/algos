# 1996. The Number of Weak Characters in the Game

## Description
You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has **two** main properties: **attack** and **defense**. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where `properties[i] = [attacki, defensei]` represents the properties of the `ith` character in the game.

A character is said to be **weak** if any other character has **both** attack and defense levels **strictly greater** than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character `i` is said to be **weak** if there exists another character `j` where `attackj > attacki` and `defensej > defensei`.

Return *the number of **weak** characters*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]
Output: 0
Explanation: No character has strictly greater attack and defense than the other.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: properties = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The first character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: properties = [[1,5],[10,4],[4,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The third character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWeakCharacters(self, properties: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ans = 0        
        
        dd = defaultdict(list)
        for attack, defense in sorted(properties):
            dd[attack] += [defense]
        
        y_min = -1
        for i in sorted(dd.keys(), reverse=True):
            temp_min = y_min
            
            for j in dd[i]:
                temp_min = j if temp_min < j else temp_min
                ans += 1 if j < y_min else 0
            
            y_min = temp_min
        
        return ans
```
