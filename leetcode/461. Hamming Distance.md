# 461. Hamming Distance

## Description
The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return *the **Hamming distance** between them*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingDistance(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        x = bin(x).replace("0b", "")
        y = bin(y).replace("0b", "")
        if len(x) < len(y):
            x = "0" * (len(y)-len(x)) + x
        else:
            y = "0" * (len(x)-len(y)) + y
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(x)):
            if x[i] != y[i]:
                result += 1
        return result 
```
