# 743. Network Delay Time

## Description
You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return *the **minimum** time it takes for all the* `n` *nodes to receive the signal*. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/23/931_example_1.png)
```
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
Output: 1
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
Output: -1
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        graph = defaultdict(dict)
        costs = {}
        for node, to, cost in times:
            graph[node][to] = cost
            costs[node] = float("inf") if node != k else 0
            costs[to] = float("inf") if to != k else 0
            
        if n not in costs: return -1
        
        lowest_cost_node = min(costs, key=lambda x: costs[x])
        while len(costs) != 1:
            for item in graph[lowest_cost_node]:
                new_cost = graph[lowest_cost_node][item]+costs[lowest_cost_node]
                if item in costs and new_cost < costs[item]:
                    costs[item] = new_cost

            del costs[lowest_cost_node]
            lowest_cost_node = min(costs, key=lambda x: costs[x])
        
        if costs[lowest_cost_node] != float("inf"):
            return costs[lowest_cost_node]
        else:
            return -1
