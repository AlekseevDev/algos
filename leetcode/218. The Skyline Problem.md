# 218. The Skyline Problem

## Description
A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return *the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively*.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

* `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
* `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
* `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The **skyline** should be represented as a list of "key points" **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/merged.jpg)
```
Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
Explanation:
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]
Output: [[0,3],[5,0]]
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def getSkyline(self, buildings: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        points  = [(l,h,-1,i) for i, (l,r,h) in enumerate(buildings)]
        points += [(r,h,1,i) for i, (l,r,h) in enumerate(buildings)]
        points.sort(key = lambda x: (x[0], x[1]*x[2]))
        heap, active, ans = [(0,-1)], set([-1]), []
        
        for x, h, lr, ind in points:
            if lr == -1: 
                active.add(ind)
            else: 
                active.remove(ind)
           
            if lr == -1:
                if h > -heap[0][0]: 
                    ans.append([x, h])
                heappush(heap, (-h, ind))
            else:
                if h == -heap[0][0]:   
                    while heap and heap[0][1] not in active: heappop(heap)
                if -heap[0][0] != ans[-1][1]: 
                    ans.append([x, -heap[0][0]])
                
        return ans
```
