# 192. Word Frequency

## Description
Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file `words.txt`.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

-   `words.txt` contains only lowercase characters and space `' '` characters.
-   Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
-   Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

#### Example:

Assume that `words.txt` has the following content:
```
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
```

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
```
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
```


## Solution

### Bash
```bash
#!/bin/bash

declare -A counter
filepath="words.txt"
read -d '' -r words < "$filepath"
words=$(echo $words | tr '\n' ' ')

for key in $words; do
    ((counter["$key"]++))
done

for key in "${!counter[@]}"; do
    echo "$key ${counter[$key]}"
done | sort -k2,2nr
```
