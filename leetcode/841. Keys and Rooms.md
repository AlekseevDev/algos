# 841. Keys and Rooms

## Description
There are `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n - 1`Â and all the rooms are locked except for room `0`. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of **distinct keys** in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room `i`, return `true` *if you can visit **all** the rooms, or* `false` *otherwise*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        roomed = set()
        last_keys = [0]
        has_new_room = True
        while has_new_room:
            has_new_room = False
            temp = []
            roomed.update(set(last_keys))
            for k in last_keys:
                temp += list(set(rooms[k]) - roomed)
            if temp:
                has_new_room = True
            last_keys = temp.copy()
        
        return len(roomed) == len(rooms)
```
