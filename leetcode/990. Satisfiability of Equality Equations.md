# 990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations

## Description
You are given an array of strings `equations` that represent relationships between variables where each string `equations[i]` is of length `4` and takes one of two different forms: `"xi==yi"` or `"xi!=yi"`.Here, `xi` and `yi` are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return `true` *if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or* `false` *otherwise*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: equations = ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.parents = defaultdict(lambda: -1)

    def find(self, node):
        if self.parents[node] == -1:
            return node
        return self.find(self.parents[node])

    def union(self, node1, node2):
        p1, p2 = self.find(node1), self.find(node2)
        if p1 != p2:
            self.parents[p1] = p2


class Solution:
    def equationsPossible(self, equations: list[str]) -> bool:
        uf = UnionFind()

        for equation in equations:
            if equation[1:-1] == "!=":
                continue

            uf.union(equation[0], equation[-1])

        return not any(
            uf.find(equation[0]) == uf.find(equation[-1])
            for equation in equations
            if equation[1:-1] == "!="
        )
```
