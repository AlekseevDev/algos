# 547. Number of Provinces

## Description
There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `ith` city and the `jth` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return *the total number of **provinces***.

## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeLists(self, list1: List[int], list2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        return [a or b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]

    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        lenisConnected = len(isConnected)
        z = 0
        while z < lenisConnected:
            main_list = [0] * lenisConnected
            count_del = 0
            for i in range(len(isConnected)):
                if isConnected[i-count_del][z] == 1:
                    main_list = self.mergeLists(main_list, isConnected[i-count_del])
                    isConnected.pop(i-count_del)
                    count_del += 1
            z += 1
            isConnected.append(main_list)
        print(isConnected)
        return len(isConnected)
