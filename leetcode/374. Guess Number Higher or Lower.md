# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

## Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

* `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
* `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
* `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return *the number that I picked*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        mass = range(1, n+1)
        n = mass[n//2-1]
        while guess(n) != 0:
            if guess(n) == 1:
                mass = mass[mass.index(n)+1:]
            else:
                mass = mass[:mass.index(n)+1]
            n = mass[len(mass)//2-1]
        return n
            
```
