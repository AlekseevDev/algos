# 194. Transpose File

## Description
Given a text file `file.txt`, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns, and each field is separated by the `' '` character.

#### Example:
If file.txt has the following content:
```
name age
alice 21
ryan 30
```

Output the following:
```
name alice ryan
age 21 30
```


## Solution

### Bash
```bash
# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.

echo -e '
transpose = dict()
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    file = file.read()
    for line in file.split("\\n"):
        z = 0
        for word in line.split(" "):
            if word:
                if z not in transpose:
                    transpose[z] = word
                else:
                    transpose[z] = transpose[z] + " " + word
                z += 1
for i in sorted(transpose):
    print(transpose[i])

```
