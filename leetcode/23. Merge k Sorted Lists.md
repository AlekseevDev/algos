# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists

## Description
You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

*Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.*

#### Example 1:
```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: lists = []
Output: []
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]], first=True) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        I don't like the brute force algorithm so 
        I didn't want to use it until the very end, 
        here is the algorithm I tried to implement.
        The algorithm works until the last test, where there are about 10,000 sheets
        and each has 1 element.
        
        
        index, min_val = min(enumerate(lists), key=lambda x: x[1].val)
        val = min_val.val
        if min_val.next:
            lists[index].val = min_val.next.val
            lists[index].next = min_val.next.next
        else:
            lists.pop(index)
            if not lists: return ListNode(val=min_val.val)

        return ListNode(val=val, next=self.mergeKLists(lists, False))
        
        """
        
        # Brute Force Algorithm
        head = tail = ListNode()
        nodes = []
        for l in lists:
            while l:
                nodes.append(l.val)
                l = l.next
        
        for x in sorted(nodes):
            tail.next = ListNode(x)
            tail = tail.next
