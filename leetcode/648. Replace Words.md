# 648. Replace Words

## Description
In English, we have a concept called **root**, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word **successor**. For example, when the **root** `"an"` is followed by the **successor** word `"other"`, we can form a new word `"another"`.

Given a `dictionary` consisting of many **roots** and a `sentence` consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the **successors** in the sentence with the **root** forming it. If a **successor** can be replaced by more than one **root**, replace it with the **root** that has **the shortest length**.

Return *the `sentence`* after the replacement.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
Output: "a a b c"
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def replaceWords(self, dictionary: List[str], sentence: str) -> str:
        max_len = len(max(dictionary, key=lambda x: len(x)))
        min_len = len(min(dictionary, key=lambda x: len(x)))
        res = []
        for i in sentence.split():
            z, j, r = 0, i, []
            while len(j) >= min_len:
                j = j[:max_len-z]
                if j in dictionary:
                    r.append(j)
                z += 1
            res.append(i if not r else min(r, key=len))
        return " ".join(res)
