# 824. Goat Latin

## Description
You are given a string `sentence` that consist of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.) The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

* If a word begins with a vowel (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, or `'u'`), append `"ma"` to the end of the word.
	+ For example, the word `"apple"` becomes `"applema"`.
* If a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add `"ma"`.
	+ For example, the word `"goat"` becomes `"oatgma"`.
* Add one letter `'a'` to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with `1`.
	+ For example, the first word gets `"a"` added to the end, the second word gets `"aa"` added to the end, and so on.

Return *the final sentence representing the conversion from sentence to Goat Latin*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: sentence = "I speak Goat Latin"
Output: "Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
Output: "heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa"
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def toGoatLatin(self, sentence: str) -> str:
        n = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
        ans_sentence = []
        for i, w in enumerate(sentence.split()):
            if w[0].lower() in n:
                ans_sentence.append(w+"ma"+"a"*(i+1))
            else:
                ans_sentence.append(w[1:]+w[0]+"ma"+"a"*(i+1))
        return " ".join(ans_sentence)
