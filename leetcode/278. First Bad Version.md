# 278. First Bad Version

## Description
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        if isBadVersion(1): return 1
        mass_main = range(1, n+1)
        mass = range(1, n+1)
        n = mass[n//2-1]
        while True:
            if not isBadVersion(n):
                mass = mass[mass.index(n)+1:]
            elif isBadVersion(mass_main[mass_main.index(n)-1]):
                mass = mass[:mass.index(n)+1]
            else:
                break
            n = mass[len(mass)//2-1]
            print(n)
            
        return n
```
