# 1812. Determine Color of a Chessboard Square

## Description
You are given `coordinates`, a string that represents the coordinates of a square of the chessboard. Below is a chessboard for your reference.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/screenshot-2021-02-20-at-22159-pm.png)

Return `true`* if the square is white, and *`false`* if the square is black*.

The coordinate will always represent a valid chessboard square. The coordinate will always have the letter first, and the number second.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: coordinates = "a1"
Output: false
Explanation: From the chessboard above, the square with coordinates "a1" is black, so return false.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: coordinates = "h3"
Output: true
Explanation: From the chessboard above, the square with coordinates "h3" is white, so return true.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: coordinates = "c7"
Output: false
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def squareIsWhite(self, coordinates: str) -> bool:
        ChessAlphasNum = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 5, "f": 6, "g": 7, "h": 8}
        return (ChessAlphasNum[coordinates[0]] + int(coordinates[1])) % 2 != 0
```
